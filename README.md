Projects done using Unity and Blender.

# Ray Tracer
Basic ray tracing in C# by rendering spheres on the screen. This implementation of the ray-tracing technique in a 3D environment uses 3 light sources to illuminate multiple spheres in the scene.


# Volume Renderer
Volume-rendered virtual reality learning objects using medical imaging data. This implementation allows users to 'slice' through the objects to visualize internal anatomy and renders CT scan or MRI data, in this case, it generated images of a head and vertebra.


# Scene Graph
A robot that moves it's hands and legs and follows the mouse cursor with its head. It is designed to teach the scene graph and demonstrate how rotation, scaling, and other transformations affect a node's children.


# Physics
Physics simulation involving a cannon that shoots balls at a wall, causing the wall to collapse onto a bell, which rings upon impact.


# Team Project
This project is a group project and it aims to address a chosen phobia. We decided to focus on the fear of flying and created a simulation of an airplane falling from the sky.
